# Forbidden Paths

Challenge from picoCTF 2022.



## Challenge description

Can you get the flag? Here's the [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:54554/). We know that the website files live in ```/usr/share/nginx/html/``` and the flag is at ```/flag.txt``` but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?
